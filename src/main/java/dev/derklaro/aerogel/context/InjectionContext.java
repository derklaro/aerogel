/**
 * Represents the context that is used as a node in a construction tree. A construction tree has at its root the actual
 * type that gets constructed, followed by a subcontext for each parameter, its sub-parameters and so on.
 *
 * <p>An example of a tree might look something like this:
 * <pre>
 *    [ StringHolder ]
 *       /       \
 *    [ Arg1 ]  [ Arg 2 ]
 *     /          /      \
 * [ Arg1-1 ]  [ Arg2-1 ] [ Arg2-2 ]
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>A context might proxy types in order to support circular references. Proxies are inserted in form of virtual
 * contexts into an injection context, and the node is removed after the construction of the proxied type completed and
 * the proxy has a delegate available.
 *
 * <p>If a provider returns a {@link KnownValue} back to this context, the value returned by the provider will be
 * stored by the current context and will be available to the <strong>subtree</strong> of the associated context.
 * Proxies that were created to support circular references will all be completed with the value wrapped by the known
 * value, even if the proxy was <strong>not</strong> created by the current subtree.
